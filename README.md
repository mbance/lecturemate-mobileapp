# LectureMate

## Introduction

**LectureMate** was conceived as a result of discussion looking into potential project ideas for use towards my final project. This seemed an application which would be of use and a technical challenge in designing and developing.

**LectureMate** is an application where its purpose is for use mainly in lectures as it is a tool used in helping record and make useful notes based utilising its main feature, *audio recording*, where the user can make and attach notes and relevant, useful resources to a specific timestamp.

Features of the application include:

 1. Audio recording
 2. Attachment of media:
		 - Images
		 - Video
		 - Research papers
		 - Web pages
		 - Audio
		 - 
 3. Text (notes)
